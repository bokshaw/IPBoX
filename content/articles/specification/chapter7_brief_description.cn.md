When drawings are presented, a brief description of drawings is a mandatory element in a patent specification, as required by 37 C.F.R. 1.74. This description section enhances clarity and understanding of the invention by offering concise summaries of each figure.

**Key Points:**

- **Clear and Concise:** Descriptions should be brief, clear, and informative, accurately capturing the essence of each figure and following the sequence of the figures in the drawings.
- **Consistent Labeling:** Choose a consistent labeling format at the beginning (e.g., "Figure," "Fig.," or "FIG.") and use it throughout the document. Avoid mixing formats like "Fig. 1," "Figure 2," and "FIG. 3."
- **Accurate References for Figure Variants:** When including variants such as Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C in drawings, avoid referring to them as Figure 1. It's acceptable to describe them collectively (e.g., "Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C are block diagrams..."). 
- **Description Content:** Each description typically starts with the chosen label as shown in the drawings, followed by one of these common styles:
    * **Specification of drawing format:** "Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the image processing method."
    * **Identification of key elements:** "Fig. 2 is a top view of the device having elements A, B, and C."
    * **Description of the scene:** "Fig. 1 illustates the control device in a locked state."
- **Alignment with consistent terminology:** Use language consistent with the rest of the patent application.
