Patent claims define the legal boundaries of an invention's protection. They should be precisely drafted to ensure that the boundaries of the claimed subject matter are clear and enforceable.

The claims section typically consists of independent claims, which outline the invention's broadest scope, and dependent claims, which introduce optional features or variations. Crafting these claims requires a careful balance between breadth and specificity to maintain novelty and sufficient coverage. Achieving this balance is important for effectively protecting the inventor’s rights.

Understanding the anatomy of the claims and following established drafting principles can simplify the process of creating clear and enforceable legal protections for innovations.


## Claim Types

#### 1. Independent Claim
An independent claim is self-contained and establishes the scope of a patent by outlining the essential features of an invention, without reference to other claims. The independent claim tends to be broad, laying the groundwork for more detailed claimed features.

Typically presented as the first claim, it might begin with "1. A device, comprising..." or "1. A method, comprising...". This serves to set the stage for the subsequent dependent claims, which are structured to directly reference and build upon the independent claim.

#### 2. Dependent Claim
Dependent claims add specifics to the independent claim they reference, introducing additional features or embodiments. This makes them narrower, providing a layered approach to protection. If the broad independent claim is challenged, these dependent claims can still protect various aspects of the invention. 

They typically start with phrases such as "2. The device of claim 1, wherein..." or "2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising...". Crucially, a dependent claim is required not to expand the scope of the claim it references, but rather, it should introduce further limitations or specify additional features of the invention.

<div class="example-container">
    <div class="example-header fw-bold">Claim Example</div>
    <div class="example-block">
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A portable electronic device, comprising:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a processor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a memory connected to the processor; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a touch screen display connected to the processor.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The portable electronic device of claim 1, further comprising a battery configured to power the processor and the touch screen display.<br>   
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The portable electronic device of claim 2, wherein the battery is a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.<br>
    </div>
</div>

This is a simple example, showing the typical patent claims. The independent claim (Claim 1) outlines the fundamental components of the portable electronic device. Each dependent claim (Claims 2 and 3) builds upon the previous claim, adding specific features or characteristics to the basic invention. Claim 3, being further dependent on Claim 2, adds a layered structure to specify the features more precisely. 

In essence, independent claims provide a broad, foundational description of an invention, while dependent claims refine and specify this description, adding layers of protection.

#### Multiple dependent claim

Within the category of dependent claims, multiple dependent claims reference and rely on several preceding claims. Multiple dependent claims are handled differently in various jurisdictions, with notable differences in fee structures. 

In the United States, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) imposes additional fees for multiple dependent claims. This substantial fee tends to discourage the presentation of dependent claims in a multiple dependent form. In contrast, the European Patent Office (EPO) does not typically charge extra fees for multiple dependent claims. This discrepancy in fee structures often leads applicants, especially those filing under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for international protection, to strategically amend their claims. 

Additionally, some multiple dependent claims from foreign countries may not meet US patent rules. It's generally best to avoid using multiple dependent claims in U.S. applications to save on costs and ensure compliance. For many U.S. national stage applications, preliminary amendments are usually made to convert multiple dependent claims into single dependent claims.

## Claim Structure

A patent claim is typically composed of three components: a <span class="text-base font-semibold" style='color:#7030A0'>preamble</span>, a <span class="text-base font-bold" style='color:#548235'>transitional phrase</span>, and <span class="text-base font-bold" style='color:#5A78AD'>elements and limitations</span>. The diagram below shows the claim structure::

![Example claim 1](/images/specification/claim_structure.svg)

<span class="text-base font-semibold text-lg" style='color:#7030A0'>Preamble -</span> The preamble provides context or a general introduction to the invention, which might include its intended use or application field. It sets the stage for the claim but may not always limit the scope of the claim. The determination of whether a preamble limits a claim is made on a case-by-case basis. Essentially, the preamble specifies the subject matter of the invention and indicates the type of claim (e.g., apparatus, method, or composition).

<span class="text-base font-bold text-lg" style='color:#548235'>Transitional phrase -</span> Following the preamble is a transitional phrase, which serves as a bridge connecting the preamble to the specific elements of the claim. Common transitional phrases include “comprising,” “consisting of,” and “wherein,” each having a distinct legal implication on how the claim is interpreted. "Comprising" is inclusive and open-ended, "consisting of" is more restrictive, and "wherein" typically introduces specific conditions or properties.

<span class="text-base font-bold text-lg" style='color:#5A78AD'>Body (Elements and Limitations) -</span> The body of the claim recites the elements or features of the invention. Each element represents a necessary component of the claimed invention. Limitations within this section further refine these elements by specifying their structure, function, or interrelations.

## Claim Punctuation

Claim punctuation is an often-overlooked aspect of patent drafting. Proper punctuation in claims is not merely a matter of grammatical correctness; it can significantly affect the interpretation and scope of a patent.

**Period (.)**: Each claim in a patent application is distinctly concluded with a period. This is a strict and universal practice in patent drafting. Unlike other forms of writing, where multiple sentences with periods might be used, a patent claim is structured as a single, continuous sentence ending with one period. 

**Comma (,)**: Commas in patent claims serve to separate clauses or elements within a paragraph of a claim. The placement of commas can significantly change the meaning of the claim. The presence or absence of a comma can lead to different interpretations of the claim, thereby impacting its scope and potentially affecting the patent’s enforceability. Therefore, commas should be correctly used to ensure that the claim is clear and unambiguous.

**Semicolons (;)**: Semicolons in patent claims are used to separate distinct elements or steps, especially useful when introducing elements within a list or a series of steps in a method claim. They offer a clearer separation than commas, aiding in reducing ambiguity. Unlike commas, which typically separate items within the same paragraph, semicolons can delineate elements or steps that are often presented in a structured list format. 

**Colon (:)**: Colons may appear before a list or series of elements or steps, particularly following the preamble and transitional phrase. The colon is employed to clarify that the subsequent text is a specification or elaboration of the preceding statement.

## Antecedent Basis in Claims

A claim may be deemed indefinite due to a lack of antecedent basis when it contains words or phrases whose meaning is unclear. This lack of clarity often arises when a claim refers to an element without properly introducing it first in the patent claims. 

The requirement for correct antecedent basis is not merely a formalistic aspect of claim drafting but a substantive one. Patent examiners often enforce this principle during examination. Failure to maintain proper antecedent basis can lead to claims being deemed indefinite, which can be grounds for rejection. This highlights the necessity for attention to detail in patent claim drafting, ensuring that each element is properly introduced and subsequently referenced.

1.  **First Introduction of an Element:** Use an indefinite article like “a” or “an,” or no article for uncountable nouns such as “light” or “software” when first presenting the element in the claims.
2. **Subsequent References to the Element:** Use a definite article such as “the” or “said,” though the use of “said” is currently less common.
3. **References in Dependent Claims:** When a definite article is used in a dependent claim for an element, that exact same element should have been introduced in that dependent claim or in any claim upon which it is dependent..  

However, the application of the antecedent basis can sometimes be overly strict, leading to rejections. For instance, phrases such as “A has the same length as B” or “the number of A is two” are grammatically correct and usually don't cause indefiniteness but may still be criticized for lacking a proper antecedent basis. In such cases, constructions like “a same length” are often used, despite being grammatically unusual in standard English. For “the number of,” a phrase like “a quantity of A is two” might be used instead to avoid the ambiguity inherent in “a number of,” which differs from “the number of.”

## Claim Examples

Let's explore two independent claims, both describing the same invention with identical features but presented in slightly different formats.

<div class="example-container">
    <div class="example-header fw-bold">Claim Example 1</div>
    <div class="example-block">
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A wearable electronic apparatus, comprising:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a ring-shaped body;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sensor module; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wireless communication module;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein the ring-shaped body is configured to be worn around a human finger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sensor module is embedded within the ring-shaped body;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wireless communication module is embedded within the ring-shaped body for establishing a communication link with an external device; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wearable finger device is configured to transmit data collected by the sensor module to the external device via the wireless communication module.
    </div>
</div>

This claim effectively breaks down the description into two parts. It lists the elements of the invention, followed by a "wherein" clause that defines the functions or characteristics of these elements. This format is particularly helpful in the initial claim drafting process, as it allows for listing the essential elements and then separately detailing their individual features.

<div class="example-container">
    <div class="example-header fw-bold">Claim Example 2</div>
    <div class="example-block">
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A wearable electronic apparatus, comprising:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a ring-shaped body configured to be worn around a human finger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sensor module embedded within the ring-shaped body; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wireless communication module embedded within the ring-  shaped body for establishing a communication link with an external device;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein the wearable finger device is configured to transmit data collected by the sensor module to the external device via the wireless communication module.
    </div>
</div>

The second version of the claim integrates the description of the elements with their locations or intended functions into a cohesive statement. This reduces the necessity of concluding all limitations within a “wherein” clause. This format is appreciated for its directness and succinctness, primarily focusing the “wherein” clause on highlighting the invention's critical or novel attributes..

Choosing between these two claim styles often depends on the particular needs of the invention's description and the context. However, it's advisable in the second format to avoid following excessive limitations after an element to prevent ambiguity and maintain readability.

Regardless of the format, it is important to note that when inventive features or specific novel aspects are crucial to a patent claim, they are often included in a “wherein” clause. This clause allows for a further description or limitation of the invention’s elements, effectively distinguishing them from more generic elements. 

## Arrangement of Claimed Features 

Effective claim drafting involves a strategic organization of features. An independent claim should capture the invention's essence broadly, allowing room for negotiation during examination. Dependent claims add depth, covering significant inventive features not included in the independent claim.

The scope of the independent claim can occasionally overlap with prior art, prompting initial rejections. Rather than viewing these rejections as setbacks, inventors should see them as the beginning of a conversation with the patent office. The patent examination process should be understood more as a negotiation than a straightforward assessment. An initial Notice of Allowance for all claims, while encouraging, might suggest that the independent claims are too narrow, risking insufficient protection for the invention.

#### Layering for Protection
Adopting a strategic approach by not disclosing every innovative detail in the independent claim can be beneficial. This strategy involves organizing the claimed features and crafting dependent claims. These dependent claims should introduce significant inventive aspects not encompassed by the independent claim. In cases where the independent claim is challenged or rejected for reasons such as obviousness or lack of novelty, these dependent claims may come to the rescue. 

Dependent claims may provide thorough descriptions, specific embodiments, or variations of the invention that augment the core features. The arrangement of these dependent claims is strategic, with the ones following the independent claim addressing the most significant aspects, and subsequent claims progressively detailing less critical, yet important, features.
