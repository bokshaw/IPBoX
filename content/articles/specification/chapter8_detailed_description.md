The core of the specification is the detailed description, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the invention. It aims to:

* Enable the replication and application of the invention.
* Explain the claims clearly and precisely.
* Highlight the unique advantages and benefits of the invention.
* Outline the optimal construction or implementation method.
* Introduce alternative embodiments or variations.


## Drafting Sequence
Though the detailed description typically precedes the claims and drawings within the specification, an effective approach involves drafting it after the claims and drawings are fully developed or once a draft of the claims is in place. This workflow uses the drawings as a visual step-by-step guide and the claims as a blueprint for the elements requiring detailed elaboration.

This approach significantly simplifies cross-referencing between the drawings and claims, ensuring accurate alignment and reference numbering for each component. The primary goal is to ensure that every feature mentioned in the claims is depicted in the drawings and thoroughly described.


## Terminology Management

Creating a terminology base is an important initial step. It involves identifying and listing key technical terms that describe crucial features of the invention. This step is particularly critical for terms that refer to parts, structures, or elements indicated by numbers in the drawings. Establishing a clear and consistent set of terms helps with accurate communication of the invention's specifications and streamlines the drafting process.

#### Recognizing and Utilizing Established Terms

When preparing the specification or tranlating one, it’s important to identify and use established terms in the invention’s field. Avoid creating new terms if established ones are available. For well-understood terms, reference existing, reliable definitions. If introducing new terminology, define these terms clearly to maintain coherence throughout the document. 

For example, an inventor describing a new water filter might use "micro-cleansing flow" to emphasize its ability to remove impurities on a microscopic level. However, the established term “microfiltration” is already well-understood within the industry and conveys a similar concept. If still using “micro-cleansing flow,” it should be clearly described or defined, perhaps stating, “‘micro-cleansing flow’ refers to a process that achieves 99.9% removal of particles smaller than 1 microns.” 

#### General Technical Terms

The choice between a common term and a more descriptive or technical term can significantly influence the clarity, scope, and enforceability of a patent. For instance, deciding between "muffler" and "silencer" or "a silencing apparatus" largely depends on the intended application of the invention. If the design is specifically for use in an automobile exhaust system, "muffler" is the appropriate term, as illustrated by "a muffler for an exhaust system of a vehicle."

In contrast, if the invention has broader applications, including automobiles, HVAC systems, or industrial machinery, terms like “silencing apparatus” or “silencer” would be more suitable. This broader applicability should be clearly indicated in the specification, even with a simple mention, such as “a silencing apparatus, designed to be installed in the exhaust pathway or similar components of an automobile, HVAC systems, or other industrial machinery.” That makes the patent’s description accurately reflects the invention’s intended use and potential, thereby enhancing its legal robustness and market relevance.

#### Generic Terms vs. Descriptive Terms

Patent description often employs generic designations “first,” “second,” “third,” etc., to differentiate elements within the same category, such as “first layer,” “second layer,” “first module,” “second module,” and so forth. This use diverges from typical grammatical conventions associated with ordinal numbers,  as phrases like “a first layer” or “a second layer” appear unconventional for those new to patent documentation. However, this practice is widely accepted to denote similar elements in patent specifications. This naming method offers flexibility without the necessity of assigning specific names that indicate material composition or function, such as “metal layer” or “feedback signal.”

Conversely, descriptive terms like “metal layer” and “conductive layer” provide insights into the composition, functionality, or characteristics of the elements they describe. These terms convey specific information that facilitates the understanding of the element’s role and nature within the invention. Nevertheless, using specific descriptive terms can inadvertently limit the scope of the invention. For instance, specifying a “metal layer” directly implies the use of metal, whereas “feedback signal” indicates a specific signal flow directionality.

The use of generic labels like “first” and “second” helps avoid these limitations. In instances where inventions include multiple similar element groups, a mix of generic and descriptive naming improves readability. For example, terms like “first electrode layer,” “second electrode layer,” “first supporting layer,” and “second supporting layer” make the naming convention more accessible and comprehensible.

However, employing such generic designations can make the invention more challenging to understand without closely referencing the drawings. Moreover, if not carefully applied, it becomes difficult to spot errors in element designation—errors that are more easily identified with descriptive names. For instance, a statement like “the metal layer insulates the leak current” is easier to flag for correction than “the second layer insulates the leak current.”

Hence, when utilizing designations like “first,” “second,” and “third,” ensure that they accurately represent elements performing specific functions or possessing distinct properties. Where possible, naming elements based on their function or application can significantly improve clarity. For instance, substituting “a first layer is an electrode” with “a conductive layer is an electrode,” or renaming “a first module that outputs a high-frequency signal” to “a high-frequency output module” simplifies comprehension and reduces reference errors.

It’s also important to note that when employing generic designations such as “first,” “second,” or directional terms like “upper,” “lower,” “left,” “right” for naming, it is beneficial to include clarifying statements in the specification. For clarity, the specification may include statements such as:

<div class="admonition-content-100">
The terms "first," "second," and similar words in this disclosure are not intended to signify any specific order, quantity, or importance but are utilized solely to differentiate among various components.
</div>

<div class="admonition-content-100">
The terms "Upper," "lower," "left," "right," and the like are used to describe the relative positional relationship. When the absolute position of the object being described is changed, the relative positional relationship may also change accordingly.
</div>


#### Relative terms

The precision of language is pivotal in patent drafting, especially when employing relative terms such as “substantial,” “about,” and “approximately” within the specification and, crucially, the claims. These terms provide valuable flexibility by broadening the invention's scope coverage. Nonetheless, it is vital to define these terms with precision to preserve the document's clarity and enforceability, preventing them from being deemed “indefinite.”

Terms like “substantial” do not inherently lack definiteness, as “claim language employing terms of degree has been found definite where it provided enough certainty to one of skill in the art when read in the context of the invention” (Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 766 F.3d 1364, 1370, 112 USPQ2d 1188, 1192-93 (Fed. Cir. 2014), citing Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45, 65-66 (1923)). However, they still carry the risk of failing to convince the examiner of their certainty. Moreover, their potential indefiniteness could complicate enforcement and litigation. Therefore, using these relative terms should be with caution in the description, particularly when incorporating them into claim language.

However, it is not discouraged to avoid the relative term in the writing description, as they capture variations of an invention, thus preventing the claims from being overly restricted to exact measurements or values. Nevertheless, quantifying these relative terms with specific definitions is essential to maintain the document’s legal and professional integrity.

<div class="admonition-content">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4500;">Original:</span> “A temperature is set about 100°C.”<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4500;">Revised:</span> “A temperature is set within a range of ±10°C of 100°C” or “A temperature is set about 100°C, herein defined as ‘about’ to be within ±10°C of the stated value.”<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4500;">Original:</span> “Component A substantially contains Component B.” <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4500;">Revised:</span> “Component A contains at least 90% of Component B by weight” or “Component A substantially contains Component B, where ‘substantially contains’ is defined as comprising at least 90% by weight.”

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4500;">Original:</span> “The threshold voltage is high.”/“the leakage current is low.”<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF4500;">Revised:</span> “the threshold voltage exceeds [voltage value]” and “the leakage current is below [current value]” or “the threshold voltage is deemed high, being above [voltage value]” and “The leakage current remains low, falling below [current value].”

</div>

It is generally acceptable to include a definition either at the beginning or at the end of the detailed descriptions to define the relative terms appeared in the description. This can be articulated by stating: 
<div class="admonition-content">
The terms "about" and "substantial" as used in the disclosure mean a variation of at least 90% or a tolerance within 10% of the stated value.
</div>


#### Proper Use of Acronyms

For the first use of an acronym, always spell out the full term and follow it with the acronym in parentheses. This practice should be followed for all acronyms, except for trademarks or brand names. 

For instance, in the case mentioned earlier regarding the silencing apparatus, the term "HVAC" should be presented in its full term if not referred earlier, “An apparatus for silencing, designed for installation in the exhaust pathway or similar components of an automobile, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, or other industrial machinery.”



#### Consistency in Term Usage

Consistency in term usage in patent drafting is not merely a matter of stylistic preference but a critical component of effective patent strategy. It demands attention to detail from the initial drafting through the final review stages. Once a component is referred to by a specific name, stick with it to avoid confusion. Ensure consistency in the labeling and naming of parts across drawings and descriptions.

## Organizing the detailed description

The drawings act as the guide for organizing the detailed description. The visual representation generally provides a clear overview of the invention’s design and functionality, setting the stage for the drafting process. The goal is to describe the invention in clear and precise terms.

Guided by the drawings, the detailed description unfolds in a sequence that mirrors the visual representations. It usually begins with a general overview that introduces the key and innovative aspects of the invention. Subsequent sections delve into detailed descriptions of each significant component or illustrated from various angles as necessary to ensure clarity. For inventions that include specific assembly processes or feature unique operational methods, explanations of the drawing diagrams are provided to demonstrate how these elements interact.

Discussions on variations, alternative embodiments, or experimental findings may be included as they relate to the main description or towards its conclusion. This approach ensures a cohesive narrative that complements the drawings, effectively narrate the invention’s story through a combination of visuals and text. 

## Writing plainly

In patent drafting, the emphasis is not on striving for vivid descriptions or varied sentence structures. The writing style for the description tends to be direct, sometimes perceived as monotonous or simplistic, and occasionally repetitive. This uniformity in sentence construction is not only acceptable but often necessary to ensure the invention is presented clearly and accurately. 

Unlike scientific papers, where the objective is often to delve into complex theories and impress peers within rigorous analysis and discussion, the objective of patent writing is to convey the details of the invention in a manner that is both precise and comprehensible. If the description fulfills this goal, there is little need to alter the wording or style for aesthetic reasons. The key is to ensure clarity, maintain consistency across the description of the invention, and highlight the novel features of the invention. 


## Transforming Technical Documents
Transforming invention disclosures, technical briefs, or scientific papers into a patent description requires a shift in focus and presentation style. While some documents, like invention disclosures, might lack detail and require expansion to adequately describe the invention, others, such as scientific papers, often contain a wealth of information related to science and technology of the invention. 

However, the process of transforming those documents demands careful attention due to their inherently focused and sometimes theoretical content. Such content should be distilled and refocused to meet the practical requirements of a patent specification.

#### Adapting Scientific Papers 
Scientific papers and similar documents are crafted with a specific purpose, often explanatory or argumentative, aimed at knowledge exchange within a scholarly context. When adapting such technical writing for a patent description, special attention is required to ensure the narrative is refocused on the invention’s unique features that warrant protection under the claims. 

Scientific papers extensively discuss an invention’s significance, novelty, and the advancement. However, this discourse, aimed at peer exchange, might not align well with patent examination criteria. These documents tend to emphasize the motivation behind the research, prior art analysis, exploration of new mechanisms, and the presentation of novel results. As a result, the detailed description of the invention’s structure or methodology might be underrepresented.

In contrast, the patent description requires a clear and explicit delineation of the invention’s construction, organization, and intended functionality. It does this by sidelining the broader scientific context or the rigorous discussion of the results behind the invention. Patent documents focus on the specific structures, properties, or composition of the invention, with background information strictly limited to what aids in understanding the invention. Detailed discussions on prior research or theoretical explorations are minimized unless they serve to directly underscore the invention’s functionality or advantages. This markedly differentiates patent writing from academic narratives.

#### Key Adjustments
To effectively transform technical or scientific documentation into a patent specification, several key adjustments are necessary. The following shifts are necessary:

•	**Focus on the Invention Itself:** Transition from broad discussions on scientific implications and innovations to a precise exposition of the invention’s structure, methodology, and functionality. This shift ensures the narrative is specifically centered on the patentable aspects of the invention.

•	**Emphasize Claimed Features:** Describe the invention’s specific features designated for claims, emphasizing their roles and relationships in fulfilling the invention’s objectives. Narrow the focus from a wide-ranging field overview to the specific attributes and functionalities that distinguish the invention.

•	**Condense Prior Development Discussion:** Limit discussions of previous studies to those that directly contribute to understanding the invention’s novelty or utility. While scientific documents often provide an in-depth exploration of prior work, a patent specification should focus on a concise background that effectively sets the stage for the invention’s contributions and its approach to problem-solving.

•	**Selective Presentation of Results:** Concentrate on describing results that clearly demonstrate the invention’s advancements beyond existing solutions, steering clear of extensive analysis of controversial or unsupported findings. The included results should decisively demonstrate the invention’s importance, avoiding speculative or ambiguous outcomes.

•	**Exclude Incomplete or Future Research Discussions:** Avoid references to ongoing or speculative future research endeavors. Patent description should concentrate on the present invention and its current development phase, excluding any speculation about potential future research. Discussions of such a nature could inadvertently reveal undeveloped or unprotected ideas, potentially compromising future patent applications by either narrowing future patent claims or guiding competitors.
