## Establishing the Technical Background

The section titled “Field of the Invention” or “Technical Field” falls under the “Background of the Invention,” as outlined in the USPTO guidelines ([MPEP 608.01(c)](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s608.html#d0e44561)). However, it is common to present the “Field of the Invention” and “Background of the Invention” under separate headings in the specification, with the “Field of the Invention” usually preceding the “Background of the Invention.”

## Technological Classification and Relevance

The guidelines suggest that this section includes a statement about the invention’s field, potentially paraphrasing the applicable Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) definitions. The CPC is a detailed system for categorizing patents and inventions worldwide based on their technical aspects. While each patent is primarily associated with one CPC code that represents its overall focus, it is often categorized under multiple CPC codes to cover specific aspects, features, or applications that fall into different categories within the CPC system.

In this section, the general technological area of the invention is described, offering context to understand where the invention fits within the broader technological landscape. The statement should align with the subject matter of the claimed invention, concentrating on the most pertinent aspects of the CPC definitions. 

**Example:**  
Consider an invention related to a new type of smartphone battery. The relevant CPC might be “H01M 10/00 - Secondary cells; Rechargeable batteries,” covering various aspects of rechargeable batteries. If the invention also involves a power management circuit, another relevant CPC might be “H02J 7/00 - Circuit arrangements for charging or depolarizing batteries or for supplying loads from batteries.”

The technical field, therefore, can be summarized as focusing on secondary (rechargeable) batteries, specifically “rechargeable batteries for portable devices,” and may be described as: 

<div class="admonition-content-100">
The present disclosure relates to secondary batteries, more specifically to a rechargeable battery for portable devices, including a power management circuit for the rechargeable battery.
</div>

For patent drafting, it is not necessary to identify CPC codes for the invention. Instead, use general technical terms commonly associated with the invention's field to summarize its technical domain. The section remains broadly relevant and understandable without the need for specific classification knowledge at the drafting stage.
