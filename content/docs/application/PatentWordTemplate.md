The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has embraced DOCX format for patent application submissions through its [Patent Center](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/). DOCX, a word processing file format based on open standards, including Extensible Markup Language (XML), is supported by Microsoft Word 2007 or higher, Google Docs, Office Online, LibreOffice, and Pages for Mac. From January 17, 2024, new nonprovisional 111(a) applications not filed in DOCX will incur a non-DOCX surcharge of up to $400.

The USPTO offers two [DOCX templates](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/docx) as starting points for drafting your patent. These templates come with essential formatting features like proper page size, margins, and page numbering. To tailor the template for technical writing, consider the following modifications:

### Layout

**Page Size and Margins:** Use Letter or A4 page size with the default 1-inch margins. The default margin setting comply with USPTO requirements.  

**Orientation:** Display all pages in portrait mode, including those with large tables or figures. If necessary, rotate the large tables or figures to fit within the portrait orientation. Do not use landscape orientation for any pages, as the Patent Center rejects documents containing landscape pages.

### Font

1. **Choose an Appropriate Font**: Select a font commonly used in legal docusments and scientific literature, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Helvetica. Times New Roman is particularly recommended due to its wide acceptance in legal documents, academic, and research publications.

2. **Apply Uniform Font Style**: Ensure consistency throughout the document by applying the chosen font (preferably Times New Roman) to both 'Heading' and 'Paragraph' styles.

3. **Set Standard Font Size**: Adjust the font size across the document to 12 points. This is in line with the standard font size range of 10 to 12 points typically used for legal documents.

### Paragraph

 The official template employs the **List Paragraph** style accompanied by **numbering**, which includes unappealing indentation formatting. For a cleaner look, adjust the **Paragraph** style by setting the **Left Indentation** to **0** and the **Line Spacing** to **1.5 lines**.

### Numbering

Set the **Numbering** style in the **List Paragraph** as: 0001, 0002, 0003, … (Not 01, 02, 03 … or 001, 002, 003 …)

### List Paragraph Style

After resetting the List Paragraph, apply this style to the main text (excluding headings).

### Headings

 Ensure that Claims and Abstract are set as **Heading 1** and headings like “SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION,” “BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS,” “DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION” as **Heading 2**. This will facilitate easier section detection in the Patent Center.

### Remove Unnecessary Headings

 Based on your document’s needs, eliminate non-essential headings, retaining key sections like “BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION,” “TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION,” etc.
